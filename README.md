The application analyses the financial records of a company. A dataset had been provided, and the application analyses the records to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period and the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

## Your Task

This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file.

## Instructions

Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, clone it to your computer.
Copy the starter files into your local git repository.
You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))
The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: -2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
